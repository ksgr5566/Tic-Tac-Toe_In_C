# Tic-Tac-Toe_In_C
A computer Tic-Tac-Toe player written without using any algorithms in C language. It's inefficient and long.

I tried writing without using Minimax algorithm to see how far I can take it manually which made it really lengthy for what could have been compact.
Written using many if statements..
